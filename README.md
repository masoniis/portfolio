# Info
Personal portfolio made with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS as well as Typescript. Implemented a cool sorting algorithm visualization that works with any input string, which in this site's case is my name!

## Inspiration
VERY heavy inspiration from [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com/)

- Main site layout concept
- Cool mouse gradient following you idea
- Project view table design

Regardless of the inspiration, nothing was copied directly, and most of the design was done entirely by me. I also decided to make some improvements that I thought fit like sorting of the table, and easily extensible theming.
